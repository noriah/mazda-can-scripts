# Mazda3 CANBUS Scripts

These are scripts that were written in the middle of summer in Texas in 2017,
on one of the hottest days of the year,
sitting in my parked 2010 mazda 3 with a broken AC, with black interior.

Literal blood, sweat, and tears were put into the making of these scripts.
From the cut i got removing a panel to access the CAN bus.
To the previously mentioned blistering hot day bringing out the sweat.

That being said. Use at your own risk.
Obviously messing with a car's internal communication systems is a ***VERY BAD IDEA***.
